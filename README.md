## DESCRIPTION

This is a personal project that I worked on during my freshmen year at Youngstown State University.
This is a C++ project, and is not associated with any of my schoolwork.

## HOW TO USE

Since this is a c++ code, you can need to have a text editor (I would prefer Microsoft Visual Studio).
Once you have a text editor, you can download this code and run this program through your text editor

If you don't want to install a text editor, you'll have to install the gcc compiler for your desktop.
It can be downloaded through the MinGW website which can be found here:

```[MinGW]```(www.mingw.org)

Once you have downloaded the compiler, go to Command Prompt or Terminal depending on your Operating System
From there, you'll have to change your directory to the location where you have downloaded this file.
You can do that by 
```cd YOUR_FILE_LOCATION```

After that you'll have to compile the code by
```g++ FILE_NAME```

Finally, to run it 
```a.exe ``` - for windows users
```/a.out``` - for MAC users
